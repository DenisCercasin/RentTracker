# Rent Tracker

This page serves as a starting point and overview of the RentTracker project.

We are still actively working on core components such as the installation guide, usage instructions, and feature documentation. As the project progresses toward completion, these sections will be added incrementally.

For now, please refer to the documentation available in Github Pages ([Docs](https://deniscercasin.github.io/RentTracker/)) for complete and up-to-date information about our goals, value proposition, screen designs, and implementation details.
