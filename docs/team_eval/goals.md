### ðŸ‘¥ Group Goals

As a team, we aim to:
- Deliver a fully functional MVP focused on landlord-side operations
- Follow best practices in software architecture, version control, and documentation
- Use agile-style iterations, starting from Figma designs through backend and frontend integration
- Present a clean, usable, and extensible codebase to be able to enhance the project in the future
- Give our MVP to the first customers, collect/interpret their feedback

### ðŸ’» Project Goals
> The following project goals were derived from a combination of the module **Full-Stack Web Development** requirements, real-world pain points of our target users, our personal learning objectives, and the limited timeframe available for implementation. 
>  
> All goals are prioritized using the **MoSCoW method**. See the [MoSCoW Prioritization](../wiki/MoSCoW-Prioritization-Method.md/) page for more details.
>
> All project goals are evaluated based on our internal [Definition of Done](/wiki/definition-of-done/) - standards each feature must meet before being marked as finished.


#### âœ… Must Have
These features are core to the MVP and will be implemented first:
- Admin (landlord) can log in, register, and stay logged in via sessions
- Manage apartments with full CRUD (address and basic details)
- Manage tenants with full CRUD (name, contact)
- Create rental agreements (tenant â†” apartment with start/end/rent price)
- Track monthly payments (who paid, for what apartment and month)
- Generate monthly summary of unpaid rent (automatically)
- One JSON API endpoint (e.g. for listing unpaid rents)
- All frontend views rendered with Jinja2, styled with basic HTML/CSS
- At least 10 Flask routes across different HTTP methods

#### ðŸŸ¡ Should Have
Important features that improve the experience but arenâ€™t critical:
- Email notifications to landlords with monthly summaries
- Filter option in table "Paid Months" by apartment
- Better input validation and flash messages for user feedback
- Possibility to upload ID of the tenant

#### ðŸŸ¢ Could Have
Nice additions if time permits:
- Tenant login with access to their payment history
- Optional Telegram bot integration for reminders

#### ðŸš« Wonâ€™t Have (for now)
These features are out of scope for this release:
- Online payment integration (e.g. Stripe, PayPal)
- Real-time dashboard or analytics graphs
- Mobile app version
- Search options in tables (e.g filter payments by month) 
- Multilingual support (Romanian, Ukrainian, Russian)
- Export summary as PDF
