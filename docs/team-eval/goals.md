### ðŸ‘¥ Group Goals

As a team, we aim to:
- Deliver a fully functional MVP focused on landlord-side operations
- Follow best practices in software architecture, version control, and documentation
- Use agile-style iterations, starting from Figma designs through backend and frontend integration
- Present a clean, usable, and extensible codebase

---

### ðŸ’» Project Goals


#### âœ… Must Have
These features are core to the MVP and will be implemented first:
- Admin (landlord) can log in, register, and stay logged in via sessions
- Manage apartments with full CRUD (address and basic details)
- Manage tenants with full CRUD (name, contact, ID upload)
- Create rental agreements (tenant â†” apartment with start/end/rent)
- Track monthly payments (who paid, for what apartment and month)
- Generate monthly summary of unpaid rent (automatically)
- One JSON API endpoint (e.g. for listing unpaid rents)
- All frontend views rendered with Jinja2, styled with basic HTML/CSS
- At least 10 Flask routes across different HTTP methods

#### ðŸŸ¡ Should Have
Important features that improve the experience but arenâ€™t critical:
- Email notifications to landlords with monthly summaries
- Optional Telegram bot integration for reminders
- Search and filter options in tables (e.g. filter payments by month)
- Better input validation and flash messages for user feedback
- Tenant CRUD: assign tenant to a new apartment on update

#### ðŸŸ¢ Could Have
Nice additions if time permits:
- Tenant login with access to their payment history
- Multilingual support (Romanian, Ukrainian, Russian)
- Apartment image upload or gallery
- Export summary as PDF

#### ðŸš« Wonâ€™t Have (for now)
These features are out of scope for this release:
- Online payment integration (e.g. Stripe, PayPal)
- Real-time dashboard or analytics graphs
- Mobile app version
- Full admin panel with role management
