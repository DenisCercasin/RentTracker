## ❗ Problem

Landlords in Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine often manage their rental operations manually, typically using paper notebooks to track tenant data and payment statuses across multiple apartments. 

Each month, they manually check who needs to pay, remember payment timelines, and follow up with tenants. Since tenants pay irregularly (some in advance, some late), tracking becomes error-prone and time-consuming. 

These manual systems are vulnerable to loss, damage, and human error, making it hard to stay organized, especially when managing many properties.


## 💡 Our solution

*Rent Tracker* is a user-friendly web application designed for landlords to digitalize their rental management process. It enables:
- Secure storage of tenant and apartment information (including ID photo, phone, email)
- Easy assignment of tenants to apartments through rental agreements
- Manual entry of monthly rent payments through simple forms
- Automatic detection of unpaid and upcoming payments
- Monthly reminders and summaries via email or Telegram — depending on the landlord’s preference

This eliminates manual work, reduces errors, and helps landlords stay in control—anytime, anywhere. The platform will launch in **English first**, with later versions in **Romanian, Ukrainian, and Russian** languages, reflecting our focus on landlords from Eastern Europe.

## 🎯 Target user

Independent landlords from **Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine** who own and lease multiple apartments.
