For any implemented feature or module to be considered ‚Äúdone‚Äù, it must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] Code is implemented and committed to GitHub
- [ ] Feature works as described in the project goals
- [ ] User input is validated (both frontend and backend)
- [ ] Page or route is fully connected and accessible through the app
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully (e.g. wrong input, 404, etc.)
- [ ] Feature is tested manually (edge cases)
- [ ] Code is commented where necessary for clarity
- [ ] README or internal docs updated
- [ ] Visuals and styling meet the Figma design (or minimal acceptable UI)
