## ðŸ§  MoSCoW Prioritization Method 
In the context of our limited time and small team size, we needed a practical and well-known method to categorize and prioritize tasks effectively. To avoid overcommitting and to focus on delivering a strong MVP, we adopted the **MoSCoW Prioritization Method**. This helped us clearly distinguish between critical features and those that could be postponed or dropped entirely.


### What is MoSCoW Method?
The MoSCoW method is a prioritization matrix widely used in project management and software development. The term MoSCoW is an acronym that stands for Must have, Should have, Could have, and Wonâ€™t have, each denoting a level of priority.

Here is the breakdown of the MoSCoW method: 

Must have: These are critical requirements that the project cannot be completed without them. If these are not fulfilled, the project is considered a failure.
Should have: These are important but not critical features of a project, and these are high-priority items that are not as time-sensitive as the Must-haves.
Could have: These are desirable features that do not affect the overall projectâ€™s success. Therefore, they can be included if time and resources permit.
Wonâ€™t have: These features are the lowest priority or are not necessary for the current delivery cycle. They are agreed upon and recognized but are dropped for the projectâ€™s current timeline.
